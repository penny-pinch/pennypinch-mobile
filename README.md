## Getting Started
If you have the Flutter environment set up on your machine, you should simply be able to try it out on any Android device by connecting it and building the binary with - 
`flutter build apk`
`flutter install`
In the very likely case of build errors or if you can't be bothered to do it, just come and find team Penny Pinchers, we're around somewhere.
